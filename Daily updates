For the first day we created 3 files: Main(ofc), Variables and Reader.
we can now store our input into list of strings.


As a group, we collectively decided to restart our programming project after evaluating our initial progress. 
We recognized that certain aspects of the project—such as
were not meeting our expectations or the project requirements.

Restarting the project allowed us to reflect on our previous approach, identify areas for improvement, 
and implement a more organized and effective plan. As a team, we have realigned our goals, restructured 
the project’s design, and incorporated better practices, such as [mention specific improvements, e.g., clearer task delegation, 
modular design, or rigorous testing].

Although restarting required additional time and effort, we believe this decision will result 
in a more cohesive and polished final product. Our team is now better organized and more confident in delivering a high-quality solution.

We appreciate your understanding and guidance as we continue working on the project.



Project is placed on second branch (master)
Just opend the SwiftInterpreter.java file, copy its code and paste it to your programming environment.
Everythin else is described in the code(example program, how methods work and etc.) with comments.
